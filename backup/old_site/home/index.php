				<p>We make games!</p>

				<p>We have weekly get-togethers. They are open to all. In the Fall 2012 term, they take place every Thursday at 6:00pm in Engineering Lab Wing (ELW). Meetings usually consist of a presentation given by a group member or somebody from the industry, then some free time to mingle and talk about projects.</p>

				<p>We need people of all trades! Artists, programmers, designers... Many group members are working on projects and could use a hand.</p>
